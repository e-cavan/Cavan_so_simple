I am now part of the Deep-Ocean Stewardship Initiative (DOSI) [Fisheries working group](https://www.dosi-project.org/topics/deep-ocean-fisheries/) led by Matt Giannia and Lissette Victorero.

The working group will actively contribute to policies and fisheries management of deep oean fisheries. I hope to contribute specifically to work on mesopelagic fisheries, climate change and carbon sinks.
