New paper out in [Ecology and Evolution showing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.7119) how feeding on detritus (krill poo) can stimulate microbial respiration of organic carbon decreasing the ocean carbon sink, whilst simultaneously providing the detritivores (i.e. krill) with essential nutrients.

This was a small experiment done at the Australian Antarctic Division in Tasmania, in their krill aquarium, a unique opportunity! Previously only modelling studies had theoretically shown that microbial gardening is an important process in the ocean biological carbon pump.
